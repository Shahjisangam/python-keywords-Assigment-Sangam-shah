    "Python keywords hold special meanings within the language and cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable names, function names, etc.). They play a critical role in defining the syntax and structure of Python programs, and they serve as instructions to the interpreter on how to execute certain operations. Here are the significances of Python keywords:\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax Definition: Keywords define the syntax and structure of Python programs, including control flow constructs like loops and conditionals, as well as function and class definitions.\n",
    "Built-in Functionality: Keywords represent built-in functionalities or operations provided by Python. They enable fundamental operations such as variable assignment, function definition, and control flow.\n",
    "Prevention of Ambiguity: By reserving specific words as keywords, Python prevents developers from using them as variable names or other identifiers. This ensures clarity and prevents ambiguity in the code.\n",
    "Standardization: Python keywords provide consistency and standardization to the language. They ensure that code written in Python follows a standard syntax and can be easily understood by other developers.\n",
    "Reserved Usage: Python keywords are reserved for specific purposes within the language, ensuring that they are not inadvertently overridden or redefined by user-defined code.\n",
    "Here are examples of five Python keywords along with their significances:\n",
    "\n",
    "if, elif, else: These keywords are used for conditional statements. They allow you to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. Example:"

Unlike many other programming languages that use curly braces {} or keywords like begin and end to define blocks of code, Python uses indentation to denote blocks.

    "Syntax: In Python, indentation is part of the language syntax. Incorrect indentation can lead to syntax errors and cause the code to behave differently than intended or not run at all.\n",
    "Readability: Proper indentation makes the code more readable and understandable. It visually separates different blocks of code, such as loops, conditional statements, and function definitions, making it easier for other developers (or even your future self) to follow the logic of the program.\n",
    "Clarity: Indentation helps to convey the structure of the code. It clearly shows the hierarchy of nested blocks, such as nested loops or conditional statements, which improves code clarity.\n",
    "Consistency: Consistent indentation style throughout the codebase makes it easier to maintain and collaborate on the code with other developers. It ensures that everyone follows the same coding standards, reducing confusion and potential errors.\n",
    "Debugging: Proper indentation can aid in debugging by visually identifying the scope of variables and the flow of execution. It helps you to quickly locate and understand potential issues in the code.\n",
